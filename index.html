	<h1>Evolution of Technology from Wired to Wireless</h1>
	<p>Technology has come a long way since the days of wired connections. Let's take a look at how it has evolved over the years.</p>
	<h2>Wired Connections</h2>
	<p>In the early days, devices were connected using wires. This meant that they had to be physically connected to each other in order to communicate.</p>
	<ul style="text-align: left;">
		<li><b>Telegraph</b> - The telegraph was invented in the early 1800s and used Morse code to transmit messages over long distances.</li>
		<li><b>Telephone</b> - The telephone was invented in 1876 and allowed people to communicate over long distances using voice.</li>
		<li><b>LAN</b> - Local Area Networks were introduced in the 1960s and allowed devices to be connected within a limited area, such as an office or a building.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Wireless Connections</h2>
	<p>As technology advanced, wireless connections became possible. This meant that devices could communicate without the need for physical connections.</p>
	<ul style="text-align: left;">
		<li><b>Radio</b> - Radio communication was invented in the late 1800s and allowed messages to be transmitted over long distances without wires.</li>
		<li><b>Wi-Fi</b> - Wi-Fi was introduced in the 1990s and allowed devices to connect to the internet without the need for wires.</li>
		<li><b>Bluetooth</b> - Bluetooth was introduced in the early 2000s and allowed devices to communicate with each other over short distances without wires.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Technology has come a long way since the days of wired connections. Today, we can communicate with each other and access information from anywhere in the world using wireless technology. Who knows what the future holds?</p>
